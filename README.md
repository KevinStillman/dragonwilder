EDIT MAY 5, 2025
Currently there are some items missing from the list of items, as well as a handful of items in the list that do not work (e.g gold ore/bars, antipoisons) I will be adding continuously so check back for updates!

EDIT MAY 6 2025
All items in the list now work with the exception or opal and jade
